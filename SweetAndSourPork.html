            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">No matter where you go, sweet and sour pork is featured on almost every Chinese restaurant menu. It’s an Asian staple. Coated pieces of meat are deep fried until golden and crunchy, then tossed in a vibrant sauce that packs a balance of sweet and tart flavors. It seems like it would be complicated to make, however, I’ve tested and broken down this recipe into two simple sections. This way you can easily make a homemade version right in your kitchen.</p>
              <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed"> <b> Step 1:</b><br>
                Place cubed pork in a medium bowl, and season with 1 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon sugar, and 1 teaspoon soy sauce. Mix in the egg white and green onions. Cover, and place in the refrigerator at least 1 hour.
                
                <br> <b>Step 2:</b> <br>
                Heat 1 quart oil to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C) in a large, heavy saucepan or deep fryer.
                
                <br> <b>Step 3:</b> <br>
                Coat the pork with 1/2 cup cornstarch, and fry in the heated oil about 10 minutes, until evenly browned. Drain on paper towels.
                
                <br> <b>Step 4:</b> <br>
                Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a wok over medium heat. Stir in the celery, green bell pepper, and onion, and cook until tender. Season with salt and sugar. Remove from heat, and set aside.
                
                <br> <b>Step 5:</b> <br>
                In a large saucepan, mix 1 cup water, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 3/4 cup sugar, apple cider vinegar, ketchup, and 1/2 teaspoon soy sauce. Bring to a boil, and stir in the cooked pork, celery mixture, and the pineapple chunks with juice. Return to boil, and mix in 2 tablespoons cornstarch and 1/4 cup water to thicken. Cook until well blended.</p>
