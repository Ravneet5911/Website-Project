            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Some Kung Pao chicken recipes require you to marinate the chicken in the Kung Pao sauce before stir-frying, but we wanted this easy Kung Pao chicken recipe to be one that you can turn to on even the busiest weeknight, so we skipped that step and found that the resulting dish was no less tasty. Here’s how to make our quick, easy Kung Pao chicken stir-fry: </p>
              <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed"> <b> Step 1: </b><br>
                Make the Kung Pao sauce: mix the soy sauce, vinegar and sugar in a bowl. (yeah, it’s that simple.)
                
                <br> <b>Step 2:</b> <br>
                Prep the chicken! Cut the boneless, skinless chicken breast into uniform strips. This is a little easier to do if your chicken is slightly frozen. Then, toss it in a little soy sauce and cornstarch to coat.
                
                <br> <b>Step 3:</b> <br>
                Cook the chicken until crispy! Working in batches so as not to overcrowd the pan, stir-fry the chicken pieces in sesame oil until they're cooked through and gorgeously crispy.

                
                <br> <b>Step 4:</b> <br>
                Stir-fry! Stir-fry the bell peppers until they're a little soft. Then add the scallions, cashews, ginger, garlic, and dried chili peppers. Stir fry all of that for a minute or two, and then stir in the Kung Pao sauce and cooked chicken.
                
                <br> <b>Step 5:</b> <br>
                Simmer. Let all of the flavors meld over the heat for a few more minutes. The Kung Pao sauce will thicken slightly and really coat the veggies and chicken, which is what you want.
                
                <br> <b>Step 6:</b> <br>
                Serve! We love to serve this over steaming bowls of white or brown rice.</p>
