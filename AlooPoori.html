                <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Aloo Puri is a favorite breakfast at my hubby’s place for Sunday mornings. Here aloo refers to potato curry and puri is Indian fried bread. Since both these dishes are served together, it named as aloo puri.</p>
                <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed"> <b> Recipe To make Aloo Sabzi </b><br></p>
                <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed"> <b> Step 1: </b><br>
                    Heat oil in a pressure cooker. Add 1 teaspoon ajwain (carom seeds) and fry them till they splutter.
                    
                    <br> <b>Step 2:</b> <br>
                    Now add ⅓ cup chopped onions (about 1 medium-sized onion or 50 grams onion).
                    
                    <br> <b>Step 3:</b> <br>
                    Sauté onions till they soften.
                    
                    <br> <b>Step 4:</b> <br>
                    Then add 2 teaspoons finely chopped ginger or (1-inch ginger), 1 teaspoon finely chopped garlic (2 to 3 small to medium garlic cloves) and 1 to 2 chopped green chillies. Sauté till the raw aroma of the ginger and garlic goes away.
                    
                    <br> <b>Step 5:</b> <br>
                    Add 1 heaped cup chopped tomatoes (about 2 medium to large tomatoes or 200 grams).

                    <br> <b>Step 6:</b> <br>
                    Stir and mix well.
                    
                    <br> <b>Step 7:</b> <br>
                    Sauté till the tomatoes become soft and pulpy.
                    
                    <br> <b>Step 8:</b> <br>
                    Add ½ teaspoon turmeric powder, 1 pinch asafoetida (hing) and 1 teaspoon red chilli powder or ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper.
                    
                    <br> <b>Step 9:</b> <br>
                    Mix well.

                    <br> <b>Step 10:</b> <br>
                    Now add 2 heaped cups diced potatoes (about 5 medium-sized potatoes or 350 grams potatoes).
                    
                    <br> <b>Step 11:</b> <br>
                    Stir and mix well.
                    
                    <br> <b>Step 12:</b> <br>
                    Add 2 cups of water.

                    <br> <b>Step 13:</b> <br>
                    Next add salt as required and mix well.
                    
                    <br> <b>Step 14:</b> <br>
                    Pressure cook for 3 to 4 whistles or till the potatoes are done.
                    
                    <br> <b>Step 15:</b> <br>
                    Here the potatoes are cooked well.
                    
                    <br> <b>Step 16:</b> <br>
                    Open the lid and simmer the aloo sabzi by pressing a few cooked potatoes with the spoon on the sides of the cooker.

                    <br> <b>Step 17:</b> <br>
                    This is to get a slightly thicker consistency of the gravy. The starch from the potatoes makes the gravy a little thick.
                    
                    <br> <b>Step 18:</b> <br>
                    Once done, sprinkle some ½ teaspoon garam masala powder.
                    
                    <br> <b>Step 19:</b> <br>
                    Also, add 1 teaspoon dry mango powder (amchur powder). Mix well and garnish with some coriander leaves.
                    
                    <br> <b>Step 20:</b> <br>
                    Serve aloo sabzi Hot with Pooris.

                <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed"> <b> Recipe To make Poori/Puri </b><br>
                    <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed"> <b> Step 1: </b><br>
                        Knead 2.5 to 3 cups whole wheat flour (atta) into a stiff dough with water and oil
                        
                        <br> <b>Step 2:</b> <br>
                        Make small balls of the dough.
                        
                        <br> <b>Step 3:</b> <br>
                        Apply oil to the dough ball. The idea of applying oil and not dusting with flour is so that while frying, the oil stays clean and you won’t see dark burnt flour particles inside the oil.
                        
                        <br> <b>Step 4:</b> <br>
                        Roll the dough evenly into circles that are neither too thin nor thick.
                        
                        <br> <b>Step 5:</b> <br>
                        Place the rolled poori in a plate and cover with a clean kitchen towel, so that they don’t dry up.
    
                        <br> <b>Step 6:</b> <br>
                        Heat oil in a deep frying pan or kadai. When the oil is sufficiently hot, then drop a small dough ball into the oil. If the dough ball rises steadily and briskly to the top, then the oil is sufficiently hot to fry the pooris. Otherwise, wait till the oil becomes hot before frying the pooris. if the dough ball rises slowly or is still at the bottom, then the oil is cold and if it rises too fast, then the oil is very hot.
                        
                        <br> <b>Step 7:</b> <br>
                        Add one puri at a time. It will puff up soon.
                        
                        <br> <b>Step 8:</b> <br>
                        Once the bottom side is golden, then turn over the puri and fry gently pressing down with the frying spoon or slotted spoon in a circular motion. fry the puri till golden brown all over. remove the poori into paper napkins to remove excess oil. Fry all pooris this way. If the oil becomes too hot, then lower the temperature by reducing the flame and vice versa.
                        
                        <br> <b>Step 9:</b> <br>
                        Serve the hot pooris with the aloo sabzi, alongside with sliced onions and some lemon wedges.
