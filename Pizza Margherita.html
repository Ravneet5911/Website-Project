            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Pizza always makes a bad day feel better, and thereâ€™s nothing nicer than a perfect slice of margherita pizza. Now you can make this recipe at home any time the craving strikes!

              Pizza margherita, as the Italians call it, is a simple pizza hailing from Naples. When done right, margherita pizza features a bubbly crust, crushed San Marzano tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella and basil, a drizzle of olive oil, and a sprinkle of salt. That is all.
              
              Another little trick I employ here is to add some grated Parmesan to the breadcrumbs, which adds another layer of flavor. You'll fry the breadcrumb and Parmesan crusted chicken breasts just to golden brown before transferring them to a baking pan and adding sauce (but not too much!), cheese, and herbs. Okay, now let's break it down.</p>
              <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed"> <b> STEP 1</b><br>
                Place a pizza stone or tiles on the middle rack of your oven and turn heat to its highest setting. Let it heat for at least an hour.
                
                <br> <b>STEP 2</b> <br>
                Put the sauce in the center of the stretched dough and use the back of a spoon to spread it evenly across the surface, stopping approximately 1/2 inch from the edges.
                
                <br> <b>STEP 3</b> <br>
                Drizzle a little olive oil over the pie. Break the cheese into large pieces and place these gently on the sauce. Scatter basil leaves over the top.
                
                <br> <b>STEP 4</b> <br>
                Using a pizza peel, pick up the pie and slide it onto the heated stone or tiles in the oven. Bake until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbling, approximately 4 to 8 minutes.
                
                <br> <b>TIP</b> <br>
                <I>In a food processor, whiz together whole, drained canned tomatoes, a splash of olive oil and a sprinkle of salt. Keep leftover sauce refrigerated.</I>
